This java program uses huffman encoding to achieve lossless compression for the txt file encoded. 

The inFile txt is use to set up or baseline char codes that we will use for the encoding process. 

The program also does a decompression of the compressed file to double check if we get lossless compression.

The main.java is the driver of the code.
